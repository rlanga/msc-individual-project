Research on how to simulate the Chord application
    - Maybe run separate instances of the entire library
    - Modify library to simulate nodes within Elixir; without JSON-RPC calls

create node registry for use in simulation mode
    - fetch node process IDs
    - stop a node process (gracefully/forced)

figure out how to pass config.exs file into simulation runs
