Research on how to simulate the Chord application
    - Maybe run separate instances of the entire library
    - Modify library to simulate nodes within Elixir; without JSON-RPC calls
* The Chord network will just be simulated using multiple Node processes
* Created alternate transport layer logic to deal with internal inter-process calls

create node registry for use in simulation mode
    - fetch node process IDs
    - stop a node process (gracefully/forced)
* Created a Util function to map a node ID to a GenServer process ID
* Created a custom Supervisor which can kill/stop a node process

figure out how to pass config.exs file into simulation runs
* Created default config.exs settings which can be overriden in simulation code

figure out how to collect simulation logs
    - Maybe use the logger backend to filter only lookup logs
    - save all log outputs to a file and run analysis after
