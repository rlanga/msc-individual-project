** evaluating KV stores **
- using CAP theorem
define availability measure
- replication
- R/W costs
- node information maintainted in steady state
- message complexity in steady state
- message complexity in inconsistent state

        ** Chord **
- a scalable protocol for lookup in a dynamic peer-to-peer system with frequent node arrivals and departures
- Three features that distinguish Chord from many other peer-topeer lookup protocols are its simplicity, provable correctness, and
provable performance
- Given a key, maps the key to a node
- communication cost and state per node scales logarithmically
- node info: (O logN) nodes
- lookup: (O logN) messages
- node changes: (O log2 N) messages

* Key structure
- no naming structure is imposed


        ** Skip Graph **
Because hashing destroys the ordering on keys, DHT systems do not support queries that seek near matches to a key, or to keys within a given range
Skip graphs can also be constructed without knowledge of the total number of nodes in advance. In contrast, DHT systems such as Pastry and Chord require a priori knowledge about the size of the system or its keyspace
