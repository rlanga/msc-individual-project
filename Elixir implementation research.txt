NIF (Native Implemented Function)
- can implement existing C functions in Elixir (maybe Rust can be used?)
* NB: a failure in the C function will bring down the entire VM

:resources
- "a safe way to return pointers to native data structures from a NIF. A resource object is just a block of memory"

- send lookup message with original requesting node

* initialisation decisions *
- bit size will be set when starting up a node as bit size knowledge is a-priori in the network
- defaiult stabilization interval is 30 seconds [chord-sectn. 6.5]
