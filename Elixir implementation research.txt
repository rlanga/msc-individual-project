NIF (Native Implemented Function)
- can implement existing C functions in Elixir (maybe Rust can be used?)
* NB: a failure in the C function will bring down the entire VM

:resources
- "a safe way to return pointers to native data structures from a NIF. A resource object is just a block of memory"

:oberver.start
- observe BEAM state in iex

- send lookup message with original requesting node

* initialisation decisions *
- bit size will be set when starting up a node as bit size knowledge is a-priori in the network
- defaiult stabilization interval is 30 seconds [chord-sectn. 6.5]

- With Node ID, use {nodeName@IPAddress} as some nodes might have the same address. In the case of them being class c addresses

- Keys can be stored in list as list size wont be that big. Lookup should be worst O(2^m)

* inter-node communication *
- options:
	- gRPC
	- JSON-RPC

- can use JSON-RPC TCP to detect when connections go down
- using HTTP(S) means connections don't have to remain open as number of open connections can scale to size m where m is bit-size

- why RPC over REST?
	- REST exposes data as resources to be acted upon, whereas RPC exposes operations as a method for acting upon data [nodricapis]

- using JSON-RPC as Elixir gRPC libraries are not yet that mature


        *** challenges faced ***
- finger table can't be implemented as list as Elixir lists are linked lists under the hood. Meaning a sparse list can't be generated. Instead a map has been used where an existing key check can be done
- Linking a transport server to a node. How does transport pass request to appropriate node
	- maybe use Agent to map server -> node
	- Due to difficulty mapping an individual transport process to a node, A physical machine will have one transport process shared amongst 1-* node processes. The issue was a limitation in the JSONRPC2 library in that it doesn't have an option to pass some initial state to the server process.
- GenServer calls will have to be non-blocking. So use GenServer.cast as a request waiting on other remote calls will block other incoming ones
